***        
A simple rendering engine for Windows, developed with the purpose of educating and demystifying low-level rendering techniques. Leveraging the power of OpenGL bindings from [Silk.Net](https://github.com/dotnet/Silk.NET/) and the widely supported [glTF](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) file format, this engine offers a comprehensive and hands-on approach to understanding the inner workings of 3D graphics programming.

- Utilizes Silk.Net for seamless integration of Windows and OpenGL rendering.
- Robust model loading and rendering capabilities, exclusively supporting the industry-standard GLB file format.
- Convenient downloading functionality for GLB models.
- Support for physically-based rendering (PBR) shaders.
- A simple and customizable direction light.
- Visual enhancement with a customizable skybox.
- Showcasing of popular avatars from [Ready Player Me](https://readyplayer.me/).
